# An android application to curb e-games expenditure

A final year project submitted as part of the requirement for the award of Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computing and Information Systems of the University of London International Programmes

## Background Information
The purpose of the android mobile app is to curb e-games expenditure through the introduction of multiple friction points to evoke contemplation and hesitancy in e-gamers, where it hopes to prompt users to think twice before making a purchase. This was created with the assumption where an One Time Pin (OTP) would be required before making a purchase.

By introducing a budget and a summary page, the app will be able to let users know the total amount spent for the current month. If in the event that users had overshot the budget, friction points will appear and users are required to go through a series of tasks before obtaining an OTP. To prevent and limit users from constantly overspending, a maximum number of times is set before the application stopped generating OTP. Every month, users would be able to set a new budget, and spendings would reset.
